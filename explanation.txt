I'm creating an app that is a self-help productivity app.
In the app the user/player/charater is born into a new world. In this world they are born in a more developed state than a human baby. More like a baby deer, capable of running, but still developing.

This world has some unique features. Rather than being born to parents you are born with a guide spirit. this spirit will help you through life to better yourself and grow.

the world is also occupied by dark spirits, demons. It is your job to fight these demons efforts to destroy you. They accomplish this through negative influence on you. The easiest way they accomplish this is by making you sluggish and stagnant. In order to stay ahead of the demons at the very least you have to move your body. Walking/running one mile a day is essential to your survival. if you were to be stagnant and do not engage with your guide spirit you will suffer loss to the demons. However, the way they can really acheive their goals is by influencing you to choose self destructive behavior, like drinking alcohol, sending an emotional text or masterbating excessively.

The way you interact with spirit and deal with these challenges is by having "face-offs" against the dark. You will log a face-off every time you face a decision in life. Spirit will guide you through these face-offs with logic flowcharts, what you choose determines whether you grow and level up or detiorate at the hands of the demons.

The face-offs will start with choosing the category of the event, for instance walking a mile, drinking alcohol, stretching, relationship interactions (choosing to respond to a text emotionally) etc. From there spirit will guide you through some thoughts on the right way to think about the choice you must make and what is the right decision to choose. along the guided logic flowchart you will have opportunities to store a brief note of advice to yourself as well.
